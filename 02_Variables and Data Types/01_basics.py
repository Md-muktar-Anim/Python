# In Python, variables are used to store data that
# can be used and manipulated throughout a program.
# A variable is created  the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 16 # integer
name = "Anim" # string
CGPA = 4.98 # float

# Rules of defining a variable in Python 

# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as varible names.

# 16age = 17 # Invalid because variables can not start with a number
age = 20 # Valid because variables can start with a letter.
#A$$$ge = 70 #Invalid because variables can not contain special characters other than (_).
__age = 80 # Valid because it follows all of the rules of python
___Anim_45 = 90 # Valid because it follows all of the rules of python
a_b_c_7_8 = "Anim" # Valid because it follows all of the rules of python
